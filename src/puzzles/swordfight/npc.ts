// The opponents. They don't play the puzzle: each one keeps the pieces it's dealt on its board as
// a tally of colours, stacked on its lowest column, and never fuses blocks.
//   - A pair comes every `pairMs`. Plain pieces go on the lowest column (ties: columns 1, 6, 2, 5,
//     3, 4).
//   - A breaker may be stored on the board (`storeChance`, up to `comboMax` at once). Otherwise
//     it shatters about `breakAverage` percent of its colour, more the higher the board is
//     (`heightBoost`), taken evenly from the columns centre first. Stored breakers go off with
//     it, up to `comboMax` of them, each shattering its own colour as the next link of a chain.
//   - Each break is sent as an attack: `strikeShare` percent of the shattered pieces as fused
//     blocks (swords), the rest as loose pieces (sprinkles), with the chain multiplier.
//   - Your attacks land on top of its columns as plain pieces, at most one every few of its pairs.
// AI skill is a preset for all of these. A second kind, GameNpc at the end, uses the game's own AI
// numbers instead: base and maximum destruction, a chain chance, and slowing down when targeted.
